title: Distance
---
The other day as I ran with my dog -- he offleash, my mind still tightly tethered to him -- the distance between us had me concerned it could be the last time I saw him.  With some tenth of a mile between us, how could I be sure he would come back?  This got me thinking about the concept of distance, how I was perceiving it, and how I would decide what to do about it.

First, there are different kinds of distance.  For example, there is how far away or how high up something is.  And then there is how long something takes.  How heavy something is.  One thing that all physical distances have in common is that they have dimensions (length, time, weight, temperature, etc.) that can be measured objectively and quantitatively.  

But there is also our perception of distances -- mental distances -- the way we experience things in the real world at a given point in time.  Unlike objective distances, a lot of mental distances are subjective and qualitative:  Is the hike short or long?  Is the path steep?  Most importantly, is the coffee hot?  Mental distances are vastly more important to us than physical ones because they determine how we parse reality and what decisions we make on a daily basis.  

Can mental distances also be measured?  In a sense, yes.  We measure them with our own internal yardsticks -- our expectations -- with most people's looking similar but not exactly alike across all dimensions.  And we mostly calibrate these yardsticks relative to common factors such as the country we’re born in, our family's values, our socioeconomic station, and what we infer about other people’s yardsticks.  

Unfortunately, our poorly refined yardsticks more often resemble slinkies than solid staffs.  Our tools, fashioned by a narrow set of familiar circumstances, a) ignore the separate and distinct nature of the phenomenon we are measuring, b) do not incorporate information from the vast majority of lived experiences that aren’t our own, and c) usually aren't calibrated all that well to begin with (lack sufficient self-reflection).  Further, they make us risk averse:  confident and inert in familiar circumstances, uncertain and prone to action in unfamiliar ones.  This is true regardless of the outcome, where sitting still (or acting rashly) could cost us dearly.   

But there is good news.  Appropriately refined, our yardsticks can be incredibly helpful.  Like magic, we can recalibrate them to help us better assess reality, overcome obstacles, and achieve our goals.  Although I'm far from figuring it out, I do know that a tool is better that is quality tested against at least a few things:

* The bounds of our own capabilities and limitations (our past experience)
* A broad set of human experience
* A wide band of timeframes
* What has (and what has not) worked well in the past
* Convex decisions (more potential upside than downside)
* Recognition that mental distances decrease over time:  people will keep setting new records, new technologies will enable increased productivity, travel will become more efficient, etc. 

My dog wants to know what all this means for his future permission to roam far and wide on our next run.  Sadly for him, I will continue to err on the side of caution, keeping him in my sights.  But for me, this consideration gives more comfort that he is nearer and more easily retrieved than that deep part of the lake might suggest.
