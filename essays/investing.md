Fair warning:  One of the best pieces of advice in investing is to learn from others’ mistakes.  Much better to not suffer the pain yourself and benefit from the lessons just the same.  This being said, the below represents a mixture of my own reflections as well as those I have shamelessly borrowed from other successful and experienced people.

Investing is simple, but it’s not easy.  It’s simply the exchange of money for assets — easy enough, right?  Unfortunately, that’s where all the simplicity ends.  The challenge lies in understanding _how much_ money and for _which_ assets.  Then, perhaps an even bigger challenge, in acting consistent with that understanding.  

__Understanding Investment Quality:  Price and Value__

First, it’s helpful to pause on what that “simple” exchange of money for assets represents.  “Price is what you pay, and value is what you get.”  Price is how much money the marginal owner of an asset asks for it at a given point in time.  Value is how many dollars will be returned from that asset, when managed according to the talent of its managers, discounted to account for the amount of time it takes to return those dollars as well as what you could have done with the money instead.  

The bigger the disconnect between what you pay and what you get, the better the investment.  So how do you decide how much value there is in a given asset?  If only it were so simple.  Here are a few considerations on my checklist:

* Will the company and its product set be relevant to customers 10 years from now?
* Do customers love the company and its products?  Are they repeat customers?
* Is the product needed rather than wanted?
* Are there disruptive technologies on the horizon?  If so, how long will they take to phase in?  Will this company be flexible and relevant enough to be the one to do it?
* Are debt levels low or at least manageable through business cycles?
* Does a good degree of security exist in the balance sheet?
* What would the value of the company be to another private owner?
* Is the investment smart on a pari-mutuel basis? (i.e. convex; more likely to increase 20% than decrease 20%)
* Does the company have the ability to keep up with or lead the competition?
* Is the company at the mercy of U.S. foreign relations, or does the company rely heavily on specific vendors with negotiating leverage?
* Has management demonstrated a track record of disciplined, thoughtful, and value creating capital allocation?
* Does management understand the company’s brand promise to the customer?
* Does management exemplify good character?
* Does management have a compelling vision for the company?
* Do profit margins or industry growth allow for some mismanagement or temporary investments in restructuring?
* What is driving the market / how are customers evolving?
* How susceptible is the company’s performance to external events?
* What does the price reflect?  What does the rest of the market understand that you don’t?  What do you understand that the market has misunderstood?
* Where does value in the company reside and where does it lie on the fundamental investment spectrum:  in the balance sheet (could be more certain), in demonstrated earnings continuing, or in potential earnings (could be less certain)?  

The direct relationship between price, value, and investment quality is crucial.  A lower price can have the same effect as waiting for many years of actual returns to materialize from a fairly priced asset, thereby making for a great annualized return possibility.  For example, it is not uncommon for shares of a company to decline by some 40% (or more) in a short period of turmoil.  For a company earning $1 per share and trading around the historical average of $15, such a decline represents a full 6 years of that company’s retained earnings.  Chances are, with enough time and absent an economic depression or a permanent change in the company’s earning potential, the company will resolve its issues much more quickly than that.  Retrospectively, investors will look back upon such an event as a “great investment opportunity.”  Few actually will have made good on that opportunity.  

__Acting on Opportunities:  Do Your Homework and Know Yourself__

Proven investors talk about psychology being one of the most important factors for investing successfully, and rightly so.  Investing, even when well reasoned, is ultimately an act of confidence.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Never lose money.  This Warren Buffett’s famous rule #1 _and_ rule #2.  This advice is incredibly sage and well deserves its top two spots:  
	* First, the mindset of a successful investor must be one of utmost diligence and careful reasoning.  That is, the investor must know the character of an investment inside and out, so much so that he can be _sure_ the invested principal is protected by the underlying value of the security.  In other words, don’t just throw money at something you know little about.  In the words of Graham, invest, don’t speculate.  
	* Second, if you have followed the previous advice, don’t sell an investment that has declined in price over a short period of time as long as your original beliefs remain intact.  If you have done your homework sufficiently, price declines simply represent even better buying opportunities.  Furthermore, you _won’t_ lose money over the long haul if you hold on, as the slow but steady process of earnings retention will add value to the balance sheet, which will ballast the value of the security.  Keep holding, and over time these earnings will recuperate your initial outlay.  Once you sell at a loss, there is no way to recuperate the initial investment (the only exception being, of course, reallocating this capital to yet another profitable enterprise).  This point further underscores the importance of not overpaying for an asset — the process of recuperating a loss can be lengthy, arduous, and in some instances impossible
* Know what you know (be confident), know what you don’t know (be intellectually honest), and know that there are things that you don’t know that you don’t know (be humble)
* No one can know what the future looks like, but you can know what a good company with good management looks like.  You can also be an observant student of human nature, which will help you know what might work and what might not, what has worked in the past and why, and what hasn’t and why not
* The market exists to serve, not to instruct
* The world's best investors make mistakes.  You can be sure to make mistakes too.  Learn from them
* Diversification and position limits protect you from a) your own ignorance; b) your own psychological limits; c) the ignorance of others transacting in the same security, impacting its price
* Don’t envy other people who make money faster or less intelligently than you do.  A) it doesn’t matter, and B) over the long haul, foolishness that is repeated doesn’t keep working
* Except in rare periods, the world’s wealth increases over time, but who holds that wealth changes.  Some (more) gain (bigger) fortunes while others lose them.  The odds are in your favor, but the outcome is far from guaranteed

__Compound Interest Gets the Last Word__

No credible piece on investing can be written that leaves out an homage to compound interest.  A lot has been written on this topic already, so I will be brief.  Compound interest and positive returns on reinvested dollars are the key to exponential investment growth.  Without them, only much slower, linear growth is possible.  Just consider:

* It takes 14 years for an investment yielding 7% per year to double with no growth and no reinvestment.  It will take 28 years to triple.  
* It takes 10 years at 7% per year to double with no growth, only reinvestment at same rate of return.  It will take 16 years to triple and in 28 years will be worth 6.6x.  
* It takes 7 years at 7% per year to double with 4% growth and reinvestment at same rate of return.  It will take 11 years to triple and in 28 years will be worth 19.2x.  

Much like low prices, compounding shortens the amount of time it takes to achieve a given return and amplifies returns over a period of time.  One additional caveat:  compounding only works when there is something to be compounded.  An asset must make money in a given period and that money, when added to the original principal, must be reinvested in a profitable enterprise in order for compounding to work its magic.  Unprofitable enterprises have no such compounding potential until they become profitable.
