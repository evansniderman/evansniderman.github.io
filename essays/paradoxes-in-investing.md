title: Paradoxes in Investing

__The worse things seem, the better they can turn out__

It’s nearly impossible for anyone to know how the future will unfold on a macro scale, and certainly not with any precision or consistency.  The landscape is continually changing, so much so that a favorable outlook in a given year may turn into an unfavorable one the next, and vice versa.  It’s senseless to get overly persuaded in either direction, as good times don’t last forever and neither do bad times.  Through ups and downs, humanity makes steady progress.  So when asset prices collapse as a result of some event that doesn’t destroy capital, even if that event persists for some time, it’s ironically the best time to buy.  Humanity has been through a lot, and human progress has outlasted everything.  

__The way to make money is to care the least about having it__ 

Investing is the eschewing of money for assets.  If you are too attached to money, you will never part with it.  In other words, you’ll never truly invest it.  Furthermore, prices never go up in a straight line, so if you are upset by the notion of losing money, you are destined to be disappointed.  However, a keen focus on spending those resources productively will result in the greatest gains.

__Investors help themselves the most by helping others the most__

Businesses exist to solve problems for their customers and enrich their customers’ lives.  If they didn’t, no one would willingly patronize them.  Those that do so most effectively and sustainably are rewarded most handsomely.
